## What is code3.5?

In short, code3.5 is a community club that aims to inspire younglings to create their very own websites.
There is a common misconception that to write code you need to be a genius. Well, I am living proof that
anyone can learn to code!

## Where is code3.5?

Currently the only location that code3.5 is running is in a Melbourne north-east suburb called Doreen. It is being run out of the Orchard Road Community Centre which is at: **Orchard Rd & Patience Ave, Doreen VIC 3754**.

## How much does it cost?

$0.00! code3.5 is absolutely free and I intend to keep it that way for as long as possible.

## Who am I?

Hi there! I'm James Formica, I'm a software developer currently working at [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au). I'm technically a UI Developer which pretty much means I specialise in making the website look good and behave well.

## Why do this?

I remember learning to code at the beginning and I also remember it being rather boring until I could build my own stuff. My goal is to run fun and interactive sessions where the whole class builds the website together and decides on the finished product.

## Will there be homework?

Nope.

## What does code3.5 mean / stand for?

Naming is hard! As you learn to code, you will discover how difficult it can be to name things. Most of the web is now built on 2 standard technologies: CSS3 and HTML5. I grabbed those numbers, put a dot between them and shoved the word 'code' in front! It may not be the most catchy name ever, but it is somewhat relevant :)
