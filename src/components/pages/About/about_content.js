## What is code3.5?

In short, code3.5 is a community club that aims to inspire youglings to create their very own websites.
There is a common misconception that to write code you need to be a genius. Well, I am living proof that
anyone can learn to code!

Honestly, code3.5 doesn't really exist yet... YET! But it will!

My goal is to run fun and interactive sessions where the whole class builds the website together and decides on the outcome. I am based out in Doreen Melbourne VIC and am hoping to utilise the community space to run the class.

## What does code3.5 mean / stand for?

Naming is hard! As you learn to code, you will discover how difficult it can be to name things. Most of the web is now built on 2 standard technologies: CSS3 and HTML5. I grabbed those numbers, put a dot between them and shoved the word 'code' in front! It may not be the most catchy name ever, but it is somewhat relevant :)

## Who am I?

Hi there! I'm James Formica, I'm a software developer currently working at [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au). I'm technically a UI Developer which pretty much means I specialise in making the website look good and behave well.
