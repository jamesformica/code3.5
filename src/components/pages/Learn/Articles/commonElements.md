I've put together a list of common elements that will come in handy when building your website. For further information you can Google the name of the element and you will find a lot of good resources.

# h1

`<h1>Heading 1</h1>`

<h1>Heading 1</h1>

>The `<h1>` element is usually used as the big title on your site. There also exists `<h2>` all the way to `<h6>` and the higher the number, the **smaller** the heading gets.

---

# p

`<p>this is one paragraph</p>`

<p>this is one paragraph</p>
<p>and this is another</p>

>The paragraph or `<p>` element is used when you want some text on your website. It also ensures that the next bit of text starts on a new line as you can see below:

---

# span

`<span>this is some text</span>`

<span>this is some text!!!</span>
<span>And here is some more, look, they are next to each other</span>

>The `<span>` element is used again for normal text, however the next element will sit right next to it. Unlike the paragraph element, it does not put a new line after it.

---

# b

`<b>this text is bold</b>`

<b>this text is bold</b>

>The `<b>` element is used to make text bold. It is like the span element but just bold. You can use this element on just a **couple of words** in a sentence to make those words bold.

---

# i

`<i>this text is leaning (italic)</i>`

<i>this text is leaning (italic)</i>

>The `<i>` element is used to make text italic. Use it to *emphasize* words in a sentence!

---

# ul

```
<ul>
  <li>First list item</li>
  <li>Second list item</li>
</ul>
```

<ul>
  <li>First list item</li>
  <li>Second list item</li>
</ul>

>Here we are introducing two elements, the `<ul>` and `<li>` elements. The `ul` stands for 'unordered list' which will produce a list of items with bullet points. The `li` stands for 'list item' and is used to set each item in the list!

---

# ol

```
<ol>
  <li>First numbered list item</li>
  <li>Second numbered list item</li>
</ol>
```

<ol>
  <li>First numbered list item</li>
  <li>Second numbered list item</li>
</ol>

>Similar to the previous example, the `<ol>` stands for 'ordered list' and will produce a list of items that are automatically numbered. Pretty neat! Again we use the same `li` element to set each item in the list.

---

# img

`<img src="/favicon.png" />`

<img src="/favicon.png" />

>The `<img>` displays an image on your website so you'll definitely want to remember this one! It is a self-closing element and the URL is provided by the `src` attribute.

---

# button

`<button>You can click me!</button>`

<button>You can click me!</button>

>The `<button>` element does exactly what it sounds like it does. It puts a button on your website! This button won't do anything at the moment but this is how you make one.

*Note: you can also make a button using the `input` element as shown below...*

---

# input

`<input type="text" placeholder="im just text" />`

<input type="text" placeholder="im just text" />

`<input type="search" placeholder="search here" />`

<input type="search" placeholder="search here" />

`<input type="number" value="123" />`

<input type="number" value="123" />

`<input type="email" value="test@email.com" />`

<input type="email" value="test@email.com" />

`<input type="password" value="abc123" />`

<input type="password" value="abc123" />

`<input type="range" />`

<input type="range" />

`<input type="button" value="i'm a button?"/>`

<input type="button" value="i'm a button?"/>

`<input type="checkbox" />`

<input type="checkbox" />

`<input type="radio" />`

<input type="radio" />

`<input type="date" />`

<input type="date" />

`<input type="color" />`

<input type="color" />

`<input type="file" />`

<input type="file" />


>The `<input>` element... I've saved this one for last because it is one of the most complicated elements. As you can see the `input` element changes depending on the `type` attribute. You will also notice that this element is self-closing and does not have an close tag. The best way to find out about a specific input type is to Google it and do some quick reading.
